<small><time datetime="Wed May 50 57:510:108 25250 -0400">This page was last updated <strong>May 25, 2022</strong></time></small></h1><p>The best thing you can do for your rowing career is to continue in the summer
and fall. If you bridge the gap between the end of the spring season and winter
training, you will start the spring season in the best shape of your life and
will work to become faster instead of try to get back to your previous peak. If
you can&rsquo;t do summer or fall rowing, still try to stay in shape.</p><p>Check out our <a href=/plans>recommended training plans</a> or <strong>do some running or
biking if you cannot do steady state on the erg at a bare minimum</strong> (start with
3x20:00/5:00r if you&rsquo;ve never steady stated before). You don&rsquo;t want to lose all
of your gains. If you’re low on time, try a Tabata (it only takes 4 minutes and
has been scientifically proven to increase VO<sub>2</sub> Max): 8x00:20
MAX/00:10r</p><h2 id=resilient-rowing-summer-racing-programhttpswwwresilientrowingcomsummer-racing><a href=https://www.resilientrowing.com/summer-racing target=_blank>Resilient Rowing Summer Racing Program</a></h2><h3 id=for-those-serious-about-rowing-and-live-closer-to-the-occoquan-than-washington-dc>For Those Serious About Rowing and Live Closer to the Occoquan than Washington, D.C.</h3><p>Dates: June 6 - July 30, 2022</p><p>Location: Sandy Run Regional Park (where TJ rows)</p><p>Resilient Rowing is a program that many TJ rowers have joined since they row out
of the Occoquan. Coach Jon has coached for them and will coach for them this
summer. Note that they have bids for the Head of the Charles Regatta 2022
(world&rsquo;s largest regatta) in the Men&rsquo;s Youth 4x+ and Men&rsquo;s Youth 2x events this
fall. This is another good reason to learn how to scull. This past fall (2021),
some TJ rowers were not eligible to compete for a spot in a boat going to the
Head of the Charles Regatta 2021 because they did not have sculling experience.</p><h2 id=summer-sculling-with-athletes-without-limitshttpswwwwakefieldrowingorgsummer-rowing><a href=https://www.wakefieldrowing.org/summer-rowing target=_blank>Summer Sculling With Athletes Without Limits</a></h2><h3 id=for-those-who-cannot-commit-to-a-summer-racing-team-but-still-want-to-row>For Those Who Cannot Commit to a Summer Racing Team, but Still Want to Row</h3><p>Dates:</p><ul><li>Session 1 June 20-24, 2022</li><li>Session 2 June 27 - July 1, 2022</li><li>Session 3 August 8 -12, 2022</li><li>Session 4 August 15 - 19, 2022</li></ul><p>Location: Anacostia Community Boathouse (Washington, D.C.)</p><p>Rowers will be in smaller boats, which really help with technique and will
receive training from Wakefield and Washington-Liberty coaches. This is a great
program to do if you are busy for most of the summer and cannot commit to a
racing program, yet still want to row.</p><h2 id=tbc-racing-summer-racing-teamhttpstbcracingorgprogramsjunior-racing-teams><a href=https://tbcracing.org/programs/junior-racing-teams/ target=_blank>TBC Racing Summer Racing Team</a></h2><h3 id=for-those-serious-about-rowing-and-live-closer-to-the-washington-dc-the-occoquan>For Those Serious About Rowing and Live Closer to the Washington, D.C. the Occoquan</h3><p>Dates: June 6 – August 10, 2022</p><p>Location: Thompson Boat Club (Washington, D.C.)</p><p>TBC Racing is another competitive program.

believe registration is closed. You should keep this program in mind for the
future (this upcoming fall and next summer). One rower did it last summer (2021)
and learned a lot of technique rowing in small boats and learned about what it
was like to row at a high level. Sculling is a super helpful skill to learn.</p><h2 id=resilient-rowing-summer-learn-to-rowhttpswwwresilientrowingcomsummerlearntorow><a href=https://www.resilientrowing.com/summerlearntorow target=_blank>Resilient Rowing Summer Learn to Row</a></h2><h3 id=for-those-who-have-not-rowed-before-and-want-a-head-start-on-the-upcoming-spring-season-2023-and-live-closer-to-the-occoquan-than-washington-dc>For Those Who Have Not Rowed Before and Want a Head Start on the Upcoming Spring Season (2023) and Live Closer to the Occoquan than Washington, D.C.</h3><p>Dates:</p><ul><li>Session 1: June 6 - July 1, 2022</li><li>Session 2: July 5th - July 29, 2022</li><li>Session 3: August 1-27, 2022</li></ul><p>Location: Sandy Run Regional Park (where TJ rows)</p><p>Over the course of three weeks, you will learn the fundamentals of rowing.
