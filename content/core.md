## Feng Core

This is a core workout created by one of TJ Crew's greats: John Feng. Legend has
it that John Feng would do three sets of Feng Core without taking a break or
breaking a sweat. This is a 10 minute core workout that works your stability and
will make your shoulders sore along with your abs. The workout is as follows:

1. 90" plank
2. 60" side plank (left)
3. 60" side plank (right)
4. 60" plank
5. 60" plank to pushup
6. 60" swing/side to sides
7. 90" Knee to elbow (basically mountain climbers)
8. 60" leg and opposite arm extended
9. 90" plank
