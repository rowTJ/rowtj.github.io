## [Resilient Rowing Summer Racing Program](https://www.resilientrowing.com/summer-racing)

Dates: June 6-July 30, 2022

Location: Sandy Run Regional Park (where TJ rows)

Resilient Rowing is a program that many TJ rowers have joined since they row out
of the Occoquan. Coach Jon has coached for them and will coach for them this
summer. Note that they have bids for the Head of the Charles Regatta 2022
(world's largest regatta) in the Men's Youth 4x+ and Men's Youth 2x events this
fall. This is another good reason to learn how to scull. This past fall (2021),
some TJ rowers were not eligible to compete for a spot in a boat going to the
Head of the Charles Regatta 2021 because they did not have sculling experience.

## [Summer Sculling With Athletes Without Limits](https://www.wakefieldrowing.org/summer-rowing)

Dates:

- Session 1 June 20-24, 2022
- Session 2 June 27 - July 1, 2022
- Session 3 August 8 -12, 2022
- Session 4 August 15 - 19, 2022

Location: Anacostia Community Boathouse (Washington, D.C.)

Rowers will be in smaller boats, which really help with technique and will
receive training from Wakefield and Washington-Liberty coaches. This is a great
program to do if you are busy for most of the summer and cannot commit to a
racing program, yet still want to row.

## [TBC Racing Summer Racing Team](https://tbcracing.org/programs/junior-racing-teams/)

Dates: June 6 â€“ August 10, 2022

Location: Thompson Boat Club (Washington, D.C.)

TBC Racing is another competitive program. They have a lot of boats and have a
heavy focus on 8's. Choose this if going to D.C. is closer than the Occoquan.

## [Potomac Boat Club U19 Sculling](https://www.potomacboatclub.org/content.aspx?page_id=22&club_id=223602&module_id=401495)

Dates: June 6 - July 31, 2022

Location: Potomac Boat Club (Washington, D.C.)

This is probably the most competitive program on this list, but unfortunately I
believe registration is closed. You should keep this program in mind for the
future (this upcoming fall and next summer). Jonathan did it last summer (2021)
and learned a lot of technique rowing in small boats and learned about what it
was like to row at a high level. Sculling is a super helpful skill to learn.

## [Wakefield Learn to Row Summer Camp](https://www.wakefieldrowing.org/summer-camp)

Dates:

- Week 1: June 20-24, 2022
- Week 2: August 15-19, 2022
- Week 3: August 22-25, 2022

Location: Anacostia Community Boathouse (Washington, D.C.)

This is a really good option for people who have never rowed before, but not
returning rowers. You will learn the fundamentals of rowing in this camp. **Get
your friends who don't do crew to sign up for this**!
