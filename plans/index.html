<small><time datetime="Wed May 50 57:510:108 25250 -0400">This page was last updated <strong>May 25, 2022</strong></time></small></h1><p>It is extremely easy to lose all of the gains you made during the season. Try to
do <em>something</em> during the summer and you&rsquo;ll reap what you sowed in winter
training and on the water in the spring. An easy to stay in shape while also
being &ldquo;lazy&rdquo; is to just do steady state while watching movies. One rower got
through a lot of the Marvel Cinematic Universe last summer (2021) while doing
3x20:00/5:00r.</p><p><strong>If you don&rsquo;t have access to an erg, please do some running and/or biking.</strong> It
can and should be slow—just make sure you do a lot of volume. If you&rsquo;re low on
time, try a Tabata (it only takes 4 minutes and has been scientifically proven
to increase VO<sub>2</sub> Max): 8x00:20 MAX/00:10r</p><h2 id=beginners>Beginners</h2><h3 id=the-pete-planhttpsthepeteplanwordpresscomthe-pete-plan><a href=https://thepeteplan.wordpress.com/the-pete-plan/ target=_blank>The Pete Plan</a></h3><h4 id=for-people-who-just-got-an-erg-but-dont-know-what-to-do>For People Who Just Got an Erg, but Don’t Know What to Do</h4><p><mark>DO THIS IF YOU DON&rsquo;T KNOW WHAT TO DO</mark></p><p>The Pete Plan is a continuous training plan, meaning it does not peak for an
event or 2k; instead, you are always in shape to 2k. Pete created workouts that
fit into his lunch hour. This is a great plan and you should supplement it with
steady state since you have more time. It will greatly improve your aerobic
base. 3x30:00/7:00r, 2x45:00/10:00r, and 5x20:00/5:00r are all great choices. Do
3x20:00/5:00r if you&rsquo;re shorter on time.</p><h3 id=coach-jons-2022-summer-training-planhttpsdocsgooglecomdocumentd1qbwqy2p2ws9djqspb3q0s40ibtme1cf8mvx77d5tgceedit><a href=https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qbwQY2P2Ws9DjQSPB3q0S40ibTME1cf8Mvx77D5tgcE/edit target=_blank>Coach Jon's 2022 Summer Training Plan</a></h3><h4 id=for-former-3v-girls-and-those-without-an-erg>For Former 3V Girls and Those Without an Erg</h4><p>This is the training plan Coach Jon made for the girls he coached this season.
He has graciously offered to share it with the team. This is a great plan to
follow if you do not have access to an erg. See these <a href=/bodyweight>bodyweight</a> and <a href=/core>core</a>
circuits for days when they are on your plan</p><h2 id=rowers-who-want-to-go-to-the-next-level>Rowers Who Want to Go to the Next Level</h2><h3 id=the-sieke-guidefilessiekepdf><a href=/files/sieke.pdf>The Sieke Guide</a></h3><h4 id=learn-the-science-behind-your-workouts-and-to-make-your-own-plan>Learn the Science Behind Your Workouts and to Make Your Own Plan</h4><p>This guide is legendary (at least on the men&rsquo;s side of the team) and is a great
place to start if you know nothing about offseason rowing. Experienced rowers
can use the guide to make productive training plans. The guide was written by
Alex Sieke, the fastest guy to ever row for TJ (less than 6:10 2k) and rowed for
Princeton before coming back to coach for TJ.</p><h3 id=stronglifts-5x5httpsstrongliftscom5x5><a href=https://stronglifts.com/5x5/ target=_blank>StrongLifts 5x5</a></h3><h4 id=the-beginner-lifters-plan>The Beginner Lifter&rsquo;s Plan</h4><p>Do the StrongLifts 5x5 plan if you have access to weights. It is great for
people with little lifting experience. Make sure to learn proper technique so
you don&rsquo;t injure yourself. Planet Fitness is giving away <a href=https://www.planetfitness.com/summerpass/registration target=_blank>free summer gym
memberships</a>. Sign up for one. The plan is dead simple, but is effective. Read
the <a href=https://stronglifts.com/5x5/ target=_blank>whole manifesto</a> to understand the goals of the plan (note that it does
have grammatical and spelling errors). Just don&rsquo;t listen to the part that says
you should not do cardio. You need to do cardio in the summer. We lift to row
well, not the other way around. StrongLifts 5x5 should be paired with loads of
steady state on the erg for maximum gains. One rower did this plan from August
2021 - Janurary 2022 and went from thinking lifting 135 lbs was hard to warming
up with 135 lbs and doing 225 lbs for 5 sets of 5 reps.</p></main><small>Source code <a href=https://github.com/rowtj/rowtj.github.io target=_blank>on GitHub</a>. Open for pull requests. This site is for TJ Crew rowers, made by TJ Crew rowers.</small></body></html>
